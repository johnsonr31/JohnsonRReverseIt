This program will take the user's number input and reverse the order of the numbers. It will only take up to seven numbers, and will ask the user to input again if they input more than seven. The user will also be given the choice to play again or not.

Peer Review: Freddy Aguilar

The program takes the users input, a series of numbers no more than 7 digits, and reverses it in the output. The program works well and functions as intended. The data validation is also on point, ensuring I dont enter an input outside of what the program is asking of me. Nicely done!
